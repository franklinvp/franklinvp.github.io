I built two wood benches.
The benches have the back legs near the ends and the front ones closer to the center.
Each pair on one side forms a square the same side of the depth of the bench.
The pieces of furniture looks like they just landed a _pas de chat_.
They were both quickly colonized by an army of potted plants.

Later we repainted the guest's bathroom and I read

![One flew over the cuckoo's nest](../assets/img/cuckoo.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block style="max-height: 80vh; width: auto;"}

Installed [Sibelius](https://www.avid.com/sibelius), which I had not used for a while to write *music*, or mess room dissorder of notes that I make to pass the time, 
or whatever you want to call it.

So, today I wrote this
