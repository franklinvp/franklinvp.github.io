title: Applied projective geometry
subtitle: Trying to draw a horizontal like without a level
---

One day I was too lazy to go get a level and didn't want to measure.
So, I tried to apply projective geometry to draw one with a no-compass, straightedge-only construction.

{: .box-note}
Two different parallel lines and a point not on them are given. Using only [straightedge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_edge) construct a line passing through the given point that is parallel to the two given lines.
